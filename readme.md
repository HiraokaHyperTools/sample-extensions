# Sample Extensions

This is a collection of WebExtensions that can be used to test stuff in Thunderbird.

To use one of the extensions, clone or download this repository and either:

* Zip the directory of your choice (`manifest.json` should be at the top level of the zip file) and install it in Thunderbird.
* Choosing "Debug Add-Ons" from the Add-Ons Manager menu, clicking "Load Temporary Add-On" and navigating to the code.
